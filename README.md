This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS to calculate widths. Specifically, the unexpected behavior occurs when mixing percentage and pixel units within the `calc()` expression.  The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` offers a possible workaround.  This issue can be difficult to track down because the browser might render the result, but not as intended.
