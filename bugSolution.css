Instead of directly subtracting pixels from a percentage value, consider using a wrapper element and applying the pixel offset to the wrapper element. This way, the percentage calculation is performed independently of the pixel offset. For example:

```css
.wrapper {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}

.inner {
  width: 100%; /* Occupies full width of the wrapper */
  /* ... other styles ... */
}
```

This approach ensures that the percentage is calculated correctly before the pixel offset is applied.  If you are working with more complex layout scenarios, explore using flexbox or grid for more predictable control of element sizing.
